For the past seven years I've been working as a Supply Chain specialist, first as Shop Floor Controller and afterwards as a Supply Chain Analyst, both experiences having brought me a good idea about what I love and what I don't in relation to my professional life and focus. Last year, after graduating from my master program in SCM and Logistics, I decided to take a break from my previous work experience and make a small detour in order to figure out what I can get from learning Data Science and related study areas, tools and technologies. This will hopefully help me find a way to improve my current skills in an attempt to find a quality job, which will ultimately bring me the happiness of a work-life balanced life.
